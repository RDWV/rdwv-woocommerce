BitcartCC is a free and open-source cryptocurrency payment processor which allows you to receive cryptocurrency payments directly, with no fees, transaction cost or a middleman.

== Description ==

BitcartCC is a free and open-source cryptocurrency payment processor which allows you to receive cryptocurrency payments directly, with no fees, transaction cost or a middleman.

BitcartCC is a non-custodial invoicing system which eliminates the involvement of a third-party. Payments with BitcartCC go directly to your wallet, which increases the privacy and security. Your private keys are never uploaded to the server. There is no address re-use since each invoice generates a new address deriving from your xpubkey.

You can run BitcartCC as a self-hosted solution on your own server, or use a third-party host.

The self-hosted solution allows you not only to attach an unlimited number of stores and use the Lightning Network but also become the payment processor for others.

#### 2.2 Third-party host ####

Those who want to test BitcartCC out, or are okay with the limitations of a third-party hosting (dependency and privacy, as well as lack of some features) can use one of the third-party hosts.
